Developed By Java

Mobile application I developed using different cycles and methods (ENJOY FRUIT)

EXPLANATÄ°ON:
In the mobile game called Enjoy Fruit, different fruits rise from the bottom section.
We get scores by cutting fruits.
There are also different icons such as money, for example;
Our life count is on the top left of the screen.
For each fruit we cannot cut, our life count decreases by one.
Red jewel icon reduces our score if cut
If the money icon is cut, it adds another life.
